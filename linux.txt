"access is denied is displayed"
chmod u+r swapna.txt // '+' represents adding the read permission to the user
cat swapna.txt
"access is given ,so that u can read the data in swapna.txt"
chmod g-r swapna.txt // '-' represents removing the read permission other than group
chmod g+r swapna.txt // '-' represents adding the read permission to the group
chmod o-r swapna.txt // '-' represents no one can read the files

cat asb.txt
"some content is displayed"
ln asb.txt swapna.txt //swapna.txt is linked to asb.txt
ls -l
"now swapna.txt is also displayed in the list"
cat asb.txt
"some content is displayed"

cat asb
echo "be confident" > asb
cat asb
be confident

be smart
think big // now both the statements are printed or stored into asb with  double greater than symbol (>>)
**************************
rm *.txt //removes all .txt files
rm -r asb//removes the directory asb
rm -rf asb//it forcfully removes the directory asb
******************************
copy command

cp asb swapna//copies all the content from asb and pastes in swapna
