                                                     LINUX FILE SYSTEM
                                                    
Linux File system:
Linux file system is generally a built-in-layer of a LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM used to handle the data management of
storage.It manages the file name,file size,creation date and much more information about a file

TYPES OF LINUX FILE SYSTEM:
1.ext3
2.ext4
3.XFS
4.NTFS
5.FAT

1.ext3:-
ext3. or third extended file system,is a journaled file system that is commonly used by the Linux Kernel.It is used 
to be the default file system for many popular Linux Distributions.
2.ext4:-
The ext4.filesystem primarily improves performanc,reliabilty and capacity.To improve reliability,meta data and journal
checksums.
3.XFS:-
XFS is a high performance 64 bit journaling file system created by silicon graphics.Inc in 1993.It was the default 
file system in SGI's IRIX operating system starting with its version 5.3.
4.NTFS:-
In Linux,you're more likely to encounter NFTS on a Windows boot partition in a dual-boot configuration.Linux can 
reliably NFTS and can overwrite existing files,but can't write new files to an NFTS partition.NFTS supports filenames of 
up to 255 characters,file sizes of up to 16 EB and file systems of up to 16EB.
5.FAT:-
FAT fullform is File Allocation Table file system format,these are commonly known by the names used in the mount command to 
invoke particular drivers in the Kernel:msdos,vfat and umsdos
